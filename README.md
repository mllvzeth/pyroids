# Pyroids

Pyroids is a Python-based clone of the classic Asteroids arcade game, built using the [pygame](https://www.pygame.org/) library. This project showcases the skills and proof of work of Marcos Alexander Chavez ([mllvzeth](https://github.com/mllvzeth)), a passionate software developer dedicated to building engaging games and interactive experiences in Python.
